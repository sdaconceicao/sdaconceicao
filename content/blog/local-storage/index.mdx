## Code

### Get Time

Cookies are stored as a giant string that has to be split and iterated over to find our value.

<CodePreview
  code={`
import x from 'x';
const storeTime = (value) => {
  document.cookie = "time=" + value.toString();
}
const getTime = () => (
    document.cookie.split(';').map(cookie => {
      const [name, value] = cookie.split('=');
      if (name === 'time'){
        return value;
      }
    })
  );
storeTime(new Date());
<div>
  The time is {getTime()}
</div>
`}
/>
